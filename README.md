# book-search

This is a book search app, that uses the Google Books API.

It uses React. Babel and Webpack are used to convert the code to ES5 and bundle it to single file.

To run the app, just open ```index.html```.

**Demo:** http://klikstermkd.github.io/book-search

If you want to play around with the code, follow these instructions:

1. If you haven't already installed Webpack, run: ```npm install -g webpack```
2. Install all required node modules with: ```npm install```
3. And finally start Webpack with: ```webpack -w```. The ```-w``` argument tells Webpack to listen on file change and update the bundle.
